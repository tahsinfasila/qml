# qml-video

## INSTRUCTIONS:

Build a simple QML-based program that: 
• Loads a video file from File Picker dialog 
• Have play and pause buttons and a progress slider 
• Slider should also allow the user to drag and seek playback position of the video file that’s being played.
• IMPORTANT: Do not use Qt widgets and do not use Qt quick controls.

## FUNCTIONALITIES – custom buttons without using QtQuick controls

* A rectangular button to choose a file that opens the file picker dialog.
* A pause/ play button that functions interchangeably.
* Control bar to hold the pause/play buttons and the seek progress bar.
* A dragger handle to control the video playback.

## PREREQUISITES TO RUN
* Make sure to add the source of the video you choose to run in the filedialog (videoPlayer.source) and have the video formatted in .wmv

  - PS: download ‘test.wmv’ file to run and test the program.
