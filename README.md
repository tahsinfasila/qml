# qml-video

## INSTRUCTIONS:

Build a simple QML-based program that: 
• Loads a video file from File Picker dialog 
• Have play and pause buttons and a progress slider 
• Slider should also allow the user to drag and seek playback position of the video file that’s being played.
• IMPORTANT: Do not use Qt widgets and do not use Qt quick controls.

## FUNCTIONALITIES – custom buttons without using QtQuick controls

* A rectangular button to choose a file that opens the file picker dialog.
* A pause/ play button that functions interchangeably.
* Control bar to hold the pause/play buttons and the seek progress bar.
* A dragger handle to control the video playback.
